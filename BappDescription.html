<p>What it does</p>
<ul>
	<li>The IProxyListener decrypt requests and encrypt responses, and an IHttpListener than encrypt requests and decrypt responses.</li>
	<li>Burp sees the decrypted traffic, including Repeater, Intruder and Scanner, but the client/mobile app and server see the encrypted version.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: Currently support AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding and AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding encryption/decryption.</p>
